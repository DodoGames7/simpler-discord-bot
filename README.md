# simpler-discord bot
this is a experimental bot running simpler-discord package, 
more info here: https://github.com/Bumblebee-3/simpler-discord

the whole package is still in development by their developers, so i wouldn't recommend running this project anyway

however feel free to fork it and self host it as well as  make your own changes against it, i made some commands for fun and learning anyway

i will continue to improve this as long as the developers of the package have added new features

# trying the bot (unstable)
be careful while testing the bot, you can self host it with glitch [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/simpler-discord-bot)
