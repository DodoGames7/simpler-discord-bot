# simpler-discord bot
this is a experimental bot running simpler-discord package, 
more info here: https://github.com/Bumblebee-3/simpler-discord

the whole package is still in development by their developers, so i wouldn't recommend running this project anyway

however feel free to fork it and self host it as well as  make your own changes against it, i made some commands for fun and learning anyway

i will continue to improve this as long as the developers of the package have added new features

# Why?
recently i was open minded and i wanted to try and test some interesting projects, so one of the days i look through one of aoi.js support profile (Fight Farewell Fearless) and they had a link to a project named simpler-discord, i was surprised at how it has similar functions to aoi.js when i looked at how simpler-discord works, so later, after a few days, i decided to create my test bot project using their package and decided to try different things with it, and that's how i ended up being making this project, however i currently have no plans of making other bots that got inspired by aoi.js library

# trying the bot (unstable)
be careful while testing the bot, you can self host it with glitch [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/simpler-discord-bot)

make sure to add a variable named `TOKEN` in .env file and fill it with your bot token to prevent your bot token being leaked on the internet <3
